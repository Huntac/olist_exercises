Working through various concepts using [olist dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) from kaggle

## Summary of Dataset

Olist is a brazillian eCommerce site where sellers can list products for sale and ship them to buyers via Olist's logistics partners. The dataset they've provided to kaggle include 9 tables covering order information, seller and customer information, geolocations, customer reviews, and a bit of portugese to english translation. This data set is great for working through conceptual excersizes because it is quite clean and covers a customer's experience at a high level.
